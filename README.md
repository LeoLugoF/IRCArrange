# IRCArrange
Reads a IRC gaussian file and rearranges it.

This little program allows users to modify the reaction path giving in a IRC gaussian file. It can be done in a reactants to products way
or an inverse way.

The new IRC is saved in a .xyz file that contains all the structures with its energy in the top of the cartesian coordinates. This file is design for Chemcraft.
